# 📁 Projects

- A vision positioning system for throat swab sampling robot: the hardware of the system includes a 6DoFs robotic arm, a depth camera in the thoracic cavity, and a depth camera at the end of the gripper, which functionally supports the visual positioning of the throat swab sampling process.
